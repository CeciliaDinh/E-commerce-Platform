- This E-commerce Platform project is all about diving into the online shopping world, crafting a system that's smooth and sticks to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF) in database design. We're using SQL to handle data, Java for the user interface, and JDBC to tie it all together, creating an all-in-one solution for running an e-commerce platform.

So, why this topic? Well, let's be real ‚Äì online shopping is everywhere! Everyone's loving the convenience of browsing and buying from their comfy couch. That's why we're cooking up a system that's gonna cater to those needs ‚Äì managing user accounts, showing off products, handling orders, and making payments quick and secure.

But this project isn't just about building any old online store. It's about crafting an experience. Picture this: folks effortlessly logging in, loading up their carts with all their must-haves, hitting that buy button, and choosing how they wanna pay, whether it's with a card or good ol' cash. It's about making online shopping a breeze for everyone involved
