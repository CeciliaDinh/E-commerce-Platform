## Topic: E-commerce Platform For Internet Banking Transactions 

[I. Introduction ‚òÄÔ∏è](#Intro)
- [1. Background](#background)
  
  - Nowadays, selling and buying products on Internet-based platforms is becoming more
and more prevalent. This development has brought a wealth of data ready to retrieve,
access, and query. Besides that, e-commerce platforms benefit both parties that take part
in.
A. Company: The host company can manage this enormous amount of data in
a more effective way compared to traditional data management methods.
B. User/ Customer: Customers are allowed to purchase products at their own
houses with no difficulties regarding payment or shipping

  **Users must be able to:**
- Create an account with their name, user bank name, and bank account number, and set up a password.

- [3. GoalsüéØ](#goal)

one, or more products from the sellers. The result of this project can display the total of
purchased products, the date of expected delivery, and the form of payment.
- [4. Installation ](#install)

[II. Methodology](#Method)
- Tools: SQL, Java, JDBC Connection
- I used SQL to create a database and insert into it with of course, random values
- JDBC Connection to connect my database with the user interface I built by Java
